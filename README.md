##Genetic Regulatory Networks using Weighted-Ensemble Stochastic Simulation Algorithm with Delays##

This repository contains the code implementation of the Stochastic Simulation Algorithmwith weighted-ensemble sampling and incorporating reactions with delays.

The prototype implementation is in Python. If necessary, it will be rewritten in a lower-level, faster language such as Fortran to permit extension to more complex networks.
