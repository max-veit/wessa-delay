#Max Veit's Undergraduate Thesis Project#
##Stochastic Simulation of Genetic Regulatory Networks with Delays##

This repository contains the code implementation of the Stochastic Simulation
Algorithm (SSA, aka Gillespie algorithm) with delayed reactions and
weighted-ensemble resampling. The code was written primarily in January-May
2014 for my undergraduate thesis.

The current implementation is in Python; see the `python` directory and
[Python readme](python/README.md) for details.

The `results` directory contains some of the plots and data used in the thesis
and accompanying presentation. The `literature` directory contains citation
data for most of the references used.

The `thesis` and `presentation` directories contain preliminary work on the
thesis and accompanying presentation, although that work has been moved to
separate branches. It may be added to this repository at some point.

if you would like help using the software. If you discover an error or would
like to add a feature I would certainly appreciate it if you could let me know,
preferaby using GitHub.
