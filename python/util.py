Some utilities for the thesis project.

Currently contains one utility for manipulating the output of the
weighted-ensemble and SSA algorithms.

No command-line functionality; this module must be imported to be used.

    Compute the joint probability distribution for a delayed trajectory.

    The average is computed over time, so the value of P(n, m) is the
    total time the trajectory spent at state n while the state tau time
    units ago was m.

    Parameters:
        traj        Trajectory from which to read the history
        tau         Delay time between the two state measurements
        paving_now  Paving for the "current" coordinate
        paving_tau  Paving for the "delayed" coorindate

    Optional Parameters:
        existing    Existing joint probability distribution; this
                    function will add its values into this array.
                    Must be a 2-D array, first index is the "current"
                    coord, second is the "delayed" coord. Obviously, the
                    shape must match the bin counts for each paving.
                    Default None, meaning a new array will be created.
        from_time   Time (on current coordinate) at which to start
                    integrating. Default None, meaning integrate the
                    entire history beginning at t = tau.
